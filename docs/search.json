Instructors announce which episode we are transitioning to. If there are background noises or other conflicts/distractions for the instructor, another instructor should take over so that person can mute themselves and take care of the issue. Provide link to overall workshop info in email and on calendar appointment (ex: https://ucsbcarpentry.github.io/2022-04-07-ucsb-r-geospatial/). I am not sure how you could have improved informing us that we needed to run the install test before the workshop, except bold and color the font red in the email??? That delayed the Thurs workshop significantly.\n\n\n2022-04-07-ucsb-r-geospatial\nMore preparedness on the instructor end. Ensure they have all the proper items (i.e. external monitors, quiet teaching environment, etc.) to be effective\n\n\n2022-04-07-ucsb-r-geospatial\nScheduling an event for late on a Friday afternoon/early evening is very challenging. I have a kid and struggled with some of the timing. ; ; Day 1 started slowly – but that was mostly because some of the learners did not do their homework in advance! Maybe separating out those folks so the rest of us could start quickly? Also, coding for 3 hours straight is mentally tough, even with a break – maybe spread into three, 2-hr sessions?; ; Overall it was fantastic - the teachers are enthusiastic, incredibly helpful, and it was a really nice experience where I learned a TON.\n\n\n2022-04-07-ucsb-r-geospatial\nfurther expansion into geospatial-specific topics, i.e. more time spent on how to process different kinds of data rather than just a lot of different options for graphing using ggplot\n\n\n2022-04-07-ucsb-r-geospatial\nProvided during business hours\n\n\n2022-04-07-ucsb-r-geospatial\nI think it was a bit confusing how to access the data we were using.

However, another hour or so would have allowed us to cover everything. In other words, more time is needed, or material should be cut (I vote for the former, not the latter). Maybe I’m just a glutton for punishment, but these two 3hr sessions flew by!\n\n\n2022-04-07-ucsb-r-geospatial\nI thought the workshop was well run\n\n\n2022-04-07-ucsb-r-geospatial\nI wish it was longer, as it was tough to pack in so much information into two 3-hour windows. I also wish it was longer to go further into this topic\n\n\n2022-04-14-ucsb-openrefine\nIn-person would be a lot easier to follow.\n\n\n2022-04-14-ucsb-openrefine\nBetter time management/less material\n\n\n2022-04-14-ucsb-openrefine\nMaybe doing it in person could be better\n\n\n2022-04-14-ucsb-openrefine\nnone\n\n\n2022-05-12-ucsb-webscraping\nDifferent date/time\n\n\n2022-05-12-ucsb-webscraping\nI think the part in-person, part virtual lesson is difficult to balance, but was handled as gracefully as possible by the instructors. I recently discovered zoom’s feature to combine all participants into a single classroom frame (immersive view - https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360060220511-Immersive-View). I’m curious if everyone (inperson and virtual) had a zoom window up if everyone would feel a bit more connected to all participants. Obvi the inperson would have to figure out audio/microphone settings.\n\n\n2022-05-12-ucsb-webscraping\nI prefer the earlier time slots when workshops are offered. I also think the hybrid structure (of zoom and in person) is a little clunky, but that is typical\n\n\n2022-05-12-ucsb-webscraping\nclearer definition of why we are doing some of these exercises; practice run for Windows (ugg) users.;\n\n\n2022-05-12-ucsb-webscraping\nI wish we could go through the entire curriculum.\n\n\n2022-05-12-ucsb-webscraping\nI’m not sure of a solution but there were a few long moments where we were just kind of a sitting waiting for people to work out their errors. It would have been nice if during that time, we could have gotten more explanation about the commands and what exactly was being done so that I could more easily apply (ie. rework the syntax) to my own research. For example, I don’t know why were looking at only the first 12 lines for this command ! head -n 12 test.html\n\n\n2022-05-12-ucsb-webscraping\nThe timing was a little tough - Friday night and started at 7 pm est so I could not stay at work but didn’t quite a have time to get home so was late. then at home my internet cut out on. But I was still happy to attend and get what I could THANK YOU!\n\n\n2022-05-12-ucsb-webscraping\nmore implications"

As a result, the workshop ran over the allocated time. I had no problem staying, but many people had to leave.\n\n\n2022-10-18-ucsb-bash-git\nSeth went out of his way to research the answers to the very specific questions I asked. It was really fun talking about how bash scripts work and how to do version control and how the conventions are.\n\n\n2022-10-18-ucsb-bash-git\ninstructor gave nice graphic explanation to help me understand abstract concept\n\n\n2022-10-18-ucsb-bash-git\nThey were very responsive to questions and ensured everyone was always caught up!\n\n\n2022-10-18-ucsb-bash-git\nInstructors clearly explained the promised topics, provided useful applications examples, and helped with troubleshooting as we followed along. They listened carefully to questions and provided thoughtful answers based on their expertise. I feel comfortable applying the bash scripting techniques immediately and feel much more up to speed on Git basics– enough to experiment with it on my own in the future.\n\n\n2022-10-25-ucsb-intro-R\nI cant remember names. All the instructors were available for answering questions and did it very well.\n\n\n2022-10-25-ucsb-intro-R\nOne instructor was very helpful and walked me through the problem solving process to fix coding issues. Another instructor was not as helpful and gave cursory overview of a possible solution.\n\n\n2022-10-25-ucsb-intro-R\nShe explained well and show how to solve my problems\n\n\n2022-10-25-ucsb-intro-R\nThe TA around are super helpful, they help debug very quickly so I can catch up with class\n\n\n2022-10-25-ucsb-intro-R\nthe stickies really helped when I had small typos or questions and felt weird about disrupting the whole workshop to ask a question\n\n\n2022-10-25-ucsb-intro-R\nThe pace was challenging since I have limited experience with coding and none with R. However, the instructors are very responsive and very good at efficiently providing clarity and help. Key was the green and red post-it method for providing feedback and getting help on the fly.\n\n\n2022-11-08-ucsb-reproducible-pubs\nThey do stop and help with my questions or bug. Follow up later if they do not know the answer right away.\n\n\n2022-11-08-ucsb-reproducible-pubs\nInstructors and helpers were prompt to answer all questions and flexible in learning lessons to accommodate unanticipated issues/errors that came up when running code, especially being that this is a new workshop.\n\n\n2022-11-08-ucsb-reproducible-pubs\nAll extremely helpful and patient, lots of one on one time\n\n\n2022-11-08-ucsb-reproducible-pubs\nAll of the new information can be overwhelming and so easy to fall behind, but all instructors provided excellent efficient one-on-one help. This was their first time teaching the course, so of course, there were challenges that arose for the teaching group–they had to to troubleshoot and try to solve. For the most part, the teachers kept on track. It is necessary to go through the guide on our own. I appreciate that it is well written. Thank you all!\n\n\n2022-11-08-ucsb-reproducible-pubs\nI felt comfortable asking clarifying questions even if the material had been covered. Also, a few instructors walked me through issues I was having.\n\n\n2022-11-08-ucsb-reproducible-pubs\nRenata answered a question for me about Rpub."

I felt I got a lot more out of it.\n\n\n2022-10-18-ucsb-bash-git\nmaybe more effective ad for more students to attend. also, sometimes it just hard to find a free schedule for 3 consecutive days for students.\n\n\n2022-10-18-ucsb-bash-git\nIt was sad it almost got cancelled! Some advertisement improvements could be made to ensure at least a slightly larger attendance. At least enough to make it financially viable\n\n\n2022-10-18-ucsb-bash-git\nThe workshop was great. More time with the instructors– another day or two– would have been valuable.

For someone new to R, there was little explanation of navigating around the various interfaces or the symbols, terminology, and script used. The exercises/challenges would also be more helpful if they were presented in a stepwise manner (like building blocks). I think it would also be more helpful for it to be more exercise or active participation based, rather than following along with what the instructor is typing. I didn’t feel there was sufficient time to code and keep up with information, especially if there was an error with my code.\n\n\n2022-10-25-ucsb-intro-R\nWill be great if refreshments are provided\n\n\n2022-10-25-ucsb-intro-R\nmore practice time?

Perhaps the workbook and course flow should be reorganized. Or having a cheatsheet available of commands we have learned so far so participants don’t have to scroll through the workbook endlessly when trying to solve a challenge. I think a fully online course would work much better (since I can’t attend in person, but grateful to have access to these courses working remotely, so I’ll take whatever you can swing!). One of the instructors shell was color coded, which was sooo much easier to follow along even though its not what my own shell looks like. Maybe multiple shell windows up at the same time so when working in nano the previous commands are still available for those who are a step or two behind. I think it would be great to emphasize somewhere in the course why command line is still important when working on modern computers. Looking forward to the next course, thanks!\n\n\n2022-07-19-ucsb-git\nGreat workshop but it might help if the instructors do not go too fast sometimes since we need to execute commands. Thank you!\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nIt would be super helpful if there was an additional day allotted to this workshop as we were unable to cover everything as planned.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\n’- There were a few uncertainties in the material taught on the 2nd day; - Some parts of the workshop were a bit fast paced; - There were a few technical difficulties on zoom in the beginning (but they were resolved in the end);\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nEverything was good. thank you.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nPerhaps providing the scripts ahead or time or afterward so that we can re-do the lessons at our leisure after the workshop.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nwould have liked to learn how to import data (e.g., from csv files, etc) to work with.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nI think some of the instructors that are not teaching at the moment should be monitoring the room a bit more. I was stuck and put up my pink sticky note, but didn’t get help until the break.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nn/a;\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nNot all instructors had a strong grasp on R, which caused some slow-downs and also caused some confusing presentation of the material. ; ; It would also be useful if the instructors presented clear and self-constrained scripts in these lessons (i.e. how one would actually organize scripts in their own work). This was done inconsistently across trainers, and there were some errors in how the scripts were managed. For example, it would be useful to tell the learners that it is important to clear your environment between scripts and to make sure that objects referenced only in previous scripts are not used in your current script.\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nN/A\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nbetter timing - although instructor commented that they rarely get through the whole thing; or plan more realistic timing goals\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nAs someone fairly new to R, perhaps a longer class (more days) to go through the lessons slower, step by step. I can do this on my own now, but it would have been nice to have more time to learn the steps. Sometimes I would have an error in my typing that took me awhile to catch and fix and by then the workshop had moved on. I was usually able to catch up or fix it later by redoing the lesson in my own timeframe.\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nincluding a quick tutorial video on the set-up page for how to get the data up n running before may help alleviate some of the issues that required troubleshooting at the beginning of the workshop\n\n\n2022-08-16-ucsb-machlearn-r\nit’s always a struggle, especially in piloted workshops, to have a good balance between getting through the planned material and allowing enough time in the workshops to provide necessary background/context info and answer questions. The first day was paced a bit fast, but we made it through the material; the second day accommodated more time for explanations, but we did not make it through the material."
