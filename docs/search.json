Plus, they really assumed people already knew the Xpath terms and such. This is what an early blurb said: “introducing tools for turning web pages into analyzable data. We will explore common web scraping scenarios and learn how to use a web browser to extract data from websites without needing to write code.” Huh.\n\n\n2024-02-27-ucsb-webscraping\nAnswered my question throughly and explained it in a second way\n\n\n2024-02-27-ucsb-webscraping\nThe workshop was ok, I don’t feel like I learned 3 hours worth of material.

I mention this because I think the topic of version control can be very confusing to newcomers. For people who are brand new to the whole topic, who I believe would be the target audience, I think it might be helpful to spend more time at the beginning going over what version control is about and the benefits of using it.

It was really fun talking about how bash scripts work and how to do version control and how the conventions are.\n\n\n2022-10-18-ucsb-bash-git\ninstructor gave nice graphic explanation to help me understand abstract concept\n\n\n2022-10-18-ucsb-bash-git\nThey were very responsive to questions and ensured everyone was always caught up!\n\n\n2022-10-18-ucsb-bash-git\nInstructors clearly explained the promised topics, provided useful applications examples, and helped with troubleshooting as we followed along. They listened carefully to questions and provided thoughtful answers based on their expertise. I feel comfortable applying the bash scripting techniques immediately and feel much more up to speed on Git basics– enough to experiment with it on my own in the future."

It’s kinda hot and stuffy inside the room.\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nmaking sure that they are familiar with the lesson and exactly what they are going to show and that there aren’t any issues before they lead the lesson. When the instructors got confused or made mistakes and had to try to fix them, it made learning already confusing things even more confusing because I was lost on what was a mistake and what was correct. In general, I believe it went a little too fast for me\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nNot jumping around directories quickly\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nBetter coordination between instructors if other instructors need to interrupt the instructor currently teaching to better explain a point or answer a question\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nClearer syllabus and more exercises\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nBreak time can come a little soon.\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\ngrep gets a little complicated with escape characters, I think those could be added to the workshop\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nnone\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nsharing instructors use for bash-shell and participants briefly sharing relevance to their own work (I mostly work in rstudio on datasets, or morphing datasets into better datasets, I rarely work with tons of files…)\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nI found it particularly difficult to follow along in this hybrid course. Perhaps the workbook and course flow should be reorganized. Or having a cheatsheet available of commands we have learned so far so participants don’t have to scroll through the workbook endlessly when trying to solve a challenge. I think a fully online course would work much better (since I can’t attend in person, but grateful to have access to these courses working remotely, so I’ll take whatever you can swing!). One of the instructors shell was color coded, which was sooo much easier to follow along even though its not what my own shell looks like. Maybe multiple shell windows up at the same time so when working in nano the previous commands are still available for those who are a step or two behind. I think it would be great to emphasize somewhere in the course why command line is still important when working on modern computers. Looking forward to the next course, thanks!\n\n\n2022-07-19-ucsb-git\nGreat workshop but it might help if the instructors do not go too fast sometimes since we need to execute commands. Thank you!\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nIt would be super helpful if there was an additional day allotted to this workshop as we were unable to cover everything as planned.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\n’- There were a few uncertainties in the material taught on the 2nd day; - Some parts of the workshop were a bit fast paced; - There were a few technical difficulties on zoom in the beginning (but they were resolved in the end);\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nEverything was good. thank you.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nPerhaps providing the scripts ahead or time or afterward so that we can re-do the lessons at our leisure after the workshop.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nwould have liked to learn how to import data (e.g., from csv files, etc) to work with.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nI think some of the instructors that are not teaching at the moment should be monitoring the room a bit more. I was stuck and put up my pink sticky note, but didn’t get help until the break.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nn/a;\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nNot all instructors had a strong grasp on R, which caused some slow-downs and also caused some confusing presentation of the material. ; ; It would also be useful if the instructors presented clear and self-constrained scripts in these lessons (i.e. how one would actually organize scripts in their own work). This was done inconsistently across trainers, and there were some errors in how the scripts were managed. For example, it would be useful to tell the learners that it is important to clear your environment between scripts and to make sure that objects referenced only in previous scripts are not used in your current script.\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nN/A\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nbetter timing - although instructor commented that they rarely get through the whole thing; or plan more realistic timing goals\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nAs someone fairly new to R, perhaps a longer class (more days) to go through the lessons slower, step by step. I can do this on my own now, but it would have been nice to have more time to learn the steps. Sometimes I would have an error in my typing that took me awhile to catch and fix and by then the workshop had moved on. I was usually able to catch up or fix it later by redoing the lesson in my own timeframe.\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nincluding a quick tutorial video on the set-up page for how to get the data up n running before may help alleviate some of the issues that required troubleshooting at the beginning of the workshop\n\n\n2022-08-16-ucsb-machlearn-r\nit’s always a struggle, especially in piloted workshops, to have a good balance between getting through the planned material and allowing enough time in the workshops to provide necessary background/context info and answer questions. The first day was paced a bit fast, but we made it through the material; the second day accommodated more time for explanations, but we did not make it through the material."
