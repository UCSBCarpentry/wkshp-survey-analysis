I had no problem staying, but many people had to leave.\n\n\n2022-10-18-ucsb-bash-git\nSeth went out of his way to research the answers to the very specific questions I asked.

They listened carefully to questions and provided thoughtful answers based on their expertise. I feel comfortable applying the bash scripting techniques immediately and feel much more up to speed on Git basics– enough to experiment with it on my own in the future.\n\n\n2022-10-25-ucsb-intro-R\nI cant remember names. All the instructors were available for answering questions and did it very well.\n\n\n2022-10-25-ucsb-intro-R\nOne instructor was very helpful and walked me through the problem solving process to fix coding issues.

However, the instructors are very responsive and very good at efficiently providing clarity and help. Key was the green and red post-it method for providing feedback and getting help on the fly.\n\n\n2022-11-08-ucsb-reproducible-pubs\nThey do stop and help with my questions or bug. Follow up later if they do not know the answer right away.\n\n\n2022-11-08-ucsb-reproducible-pubs\nInstructors and helpers were prompt to answer all questions and flexible in learning lessons to accommodate unanticipated issues/errors that came up when running code, especially being that this is a new workshop.\n\n\n2022-11-08-ucsb-reproducible-pubs\nAll extremely helpful and patient, lots of one on one time\n\n\n2022-11-08-ucsb-reproducible-pubs\nAll of the new information can be overwhelming and so easy to fall behind, but all instructors provided excellent efficient one-on-one help. This was their first time teaching the course, so of course, there were challenges that arose for the teaching group–they had to to troubleshoot and try to solve. For the most part, the teachers kept on track. It is necessary to go through the guide on our own. I appreciate that it is well written. Thank you all!\n\n\n2022-11-08-ucsb-reproducible-pubs\nI felt comfortable asking clarifying questions even if the material had been covered. Also, a few instructors walked me through issues I was having.\n\n\n2022-11-08-ucsb-reproducible-pubs\nRenata answered a question for me about Rpub."

I do work with R before (plots and easy data cleaning) and looking at the introduction I thought it’s too intro-level for me. But! It turns out that I learn so much because it dived much deeper even in the first day. In general, it is super useful for my current research.\n\n\n2022-10-25-ucsb-intro-R\nBest for total novices, the pacing was nice and slow!\n\n\n2022-10-25-ucsb-intro-R\nin-person and interactive; focus on a real data set for research\n\n\n2022-10-25-ucsb-intro-R\nthe figure making portion was the most helpful part\n\n\n2022-10-25-ucsb-intro-R\nThe workshop notes and the roaming instructors providing help on the fly are effective and essential.\n\n\n2022-11-08-ucsb-reproducible-pubs\nClarity, good doable pace\n\n\n2022-11-08-ucsb-reproducible-pubs\nGood instructor to student ratio\n\n\n2022-11-08-ucsb-reproducible-pubs\ninteresting/important topic that is not taught a lot in STEM fields, knowledgable instructors, practical skills/advice\n\n\n2022-11-08-ucsb-reproducible-pubs\n’-Number of helpers; -lots of different aspects covered; -new technology\n\n\n2022-11-08-ucsb-reproducible-pubs\nTeaching team works well together.

I felt I got a lot more out of it.\n\n\n2022-10-18-ucsb-bash-git\nmaybe more effective ad for more students to attend. also, sometimes it just hard to find a free schedule for 3 consecutive days for students.\n\n\n2022-10-18-ucsb-bash-git\nIt was sad it almost got cancelled! Some advertisement improvements could be made to ensure at least a slightly larger attendance. At least enough to make it financially viable\n\n\n2022-10-18-ucsb-bash-git\nThe workshop was great. More time with the instructors– another day or two– would have been valuable. For additional hands on experience with some of the concepts and to dig into more sophisticated aspects of those.\n\n\n2022-10-25-ucsb-intro-R\nBecoming part of a series of increasingly more complex workshops.\n\n\n2022-10-25-ucsb-intro-R\nProvide a better/more in-depth introduction into the R program. For someone new to R, there was little explanation of navigating around the various interfaces or the symbols, terminology, and script used. The exercises/challenges would also be more helpful if they were presented in a stepwise manner (like building blocks). I think it would also be more helpful for it to be more exercise or active participation based, rather than following along with what the instructor is typing. I didn’t feel there was sufficient time to code and keep up with information, especially if there was an error with my code.\n\n\n2022-10-25-ucsb-intro-R\nWill be great if refreshments are provided\n\n\n2022-10-25-ucsb-intro-R\nmore practice time? A third session for people to play more with data or bring their own datasets and questions would be great\n\n\n2022-10-25-ucsb-intro-R\nMaybe distribute some very basic resources or handouts for people to read before the class so some people can be better prepared and students may be relative on the same page.\n\n\n2022-10-25-ucsb-intro-R\nmore time on figure making\n\n\n2022-10-25-ucsb-intro-R\nTry to follow and stay on topic with the workshop notes, because the notes are very important for reviewing what was presented, reviewing what I was able to do hands on, and filling in gaps of understanding when I wasn’t able to keep up or lost track.\n\n\n2022-11-08-ucsb-reproducible-pubs\nworking out the kinks of Quarto and warning students beforehand of potential problem areas\n\n\n2022-11-08-ucsb-reproducible-pubs\nMention some pre-requisition knowledge may need in the workshop\n\n\n2022-11-08-ucsb-reproducible-pubs\ntiming of lessons was a little ambitious\n\n\n2022-11-08-ucsb-reproducible-pubs\n’-more time spent on examples maybe; -start from scratch more often\n\n\n2022-11-08-ucsb-reproducible-pubs\n’-more step by step instructions ; -point out more where we are in the lesson in case people get lost"
