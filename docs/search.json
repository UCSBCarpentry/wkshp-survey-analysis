Instructors were very helpful at identifying these errors and providing helpful tips along the way to avoid errors in the future\n\n\n2025-01-23-ucsb-geospatial\nExplaining commands\n\n\n2025-01-23-ucsb-geospatial\nThey were extremely helpful and created a lighthearted learning environment. It was clear that they respect each other as well as the students. They did a fantastic job.\n\n\n2025-01-15-ucsb-containers\nRonald was enthusiastic and clear\n\n\n2025-02-03-ucsb-computing\nI don’t think it was one particular instructor that helped the experience, but rather that there were people there to represent the many different campus resources.\n\n\n2025-02-03-ucsb-computing\nProvided concrete examples of how to use some of the resources\n\n\n2025-02-03-ucsb-computing\ninstructors were open to questions at any point during the seminar\n\n\n2025-02-03-ucsb-computing\nI think the instructors gave a good job of providing examples of when an individual may need to switch between the different types of computing systems and conceptualized what that would entail in a way that was accessible. I feel more confident in my understanding of research computing and the situations or instances when this resources could be beneficial. More importantly, I am aware of where to go on campus to ask questions and gain access to these resources.\n\n\n2025-02-18-ucsb-intermediater\nThe instructors did a good job of slowly going through the code and providing a few tips that novices can use.\n\n\n2025-02-18-ucsb-intermediater\nThe instructors were so familiar with the material that it was hard for them to step outside the mindset of a programmer and see how someone without full training in coding might need additional steps\n\n\n2025-02-18-ucsb-intermediater\nI gained more familiarity with the structure of for loops and the instances when a function may be better than a for loop and when using functions in dplyr may actually achieve coding goals quicker than a for loop.\n\n\n2025-02-25-ucsb-ml\nThey were really friendly and enthusiastic.\n\n\n2025-02-25-ucsb-ml\ni asked one question and they confirmed my thoughts\n\n\n2025-02-25-ucsb-ml\nI wasn’t affraid to let instructors know if I was stuck on a step. Some of the instructors who weren’t directly presenting were still able to provide helpful input on the potential applications of workshop materials to additional fields of research.\n\n\n2025-02-25-ucsb-ml\nOne of the instructors provided a clear and concise explanation of a complex machine learning concept by breaking it down into smaller steps. For example, when covering decision trees, they used a real-world analogy related to everyday decision-making, which made it much easier to understand. Additionally, a helper guided me through debugging a coding error, ensuring I grasped the logic behind the solution rather than just fixing the issue. Their support significantly enhanced my learning experience.\n\n\n2025-01-14-ucsb-python\nAny question I had was immediately answered and with enthusiasm, Jean especially was a very enthusiastic and helpful person!\n\n\n2025-01-14-ucsb-python\nNo, I did not encounter any accessibility issues. Everything was great, and there were no barriers to my participation.”\n\n\n2025-01-14-ucsb-python\nI am a very slow learner (new to Python; and any language for that matter), Sigrid and Jose were very patient with me. If the material sped along too quickly, they were here to offer support to get me back-on-track.\n\n\n2025-01-23-ucsb-geospatial\nhands on help(esp when things went wrong-&gt;stopped me from panicing and shutting down in frustration)\n\n\n2025-01-23-ucsb-geospatial\nThey were all super attentitve and fast in providing help\n\n\n2025-01-23-ucsb-geospatial\nGreat! Helping me determine what coding issues I was encountering rapidly.\n\n\n2025-01-23-ucsb-geospatial\nPlenty of people to offer one on one help so it was a very supportive and comfortable working environment that moved at a good slow pace for everyone too follow along. If I ever had trouble, I could put up a yellow sticky note and someone would come work with me to figure out my problem or catch up if I got behind.\n\n\n2025-01-23-ucsb-geospatial\nI didn’t show up the second to last day but when I came in the final day, one of the instructors got me all caught up on the code I needed which was super helpful\n\n\n2025-02-03-ucsb-computing\nClear slides and familiarity with the topic\n\n\n2025-02-03-ucsb-computing\nVery engaging presentations by nice presenters!\n\n\n2025-02-03-ucsb-computing\nanswered my specific questions\n\n\n2025-01-15-ucsb-containers\nThere were a couple of moments where the code was not working, and they found the solution every time.\n\n\n2025-02-18-ucsb-intermediater\none on one time and super friendly\n\n\n2025-02-18-ucsb-intermediater\nThey had clear and concise lessons and had an effective system for ensuring everyone was keeping up with the material."

There was help when you needed it.\n\n\n2025-02-18-ucsb-intermediater\nfriendly, responsive to questions\n\n\n2025-02-18-ucsb-intermediater\nI liked that the workshop alternated instructors to provide variety in the way information was shared and taught. I appreciated that there were challenges and also a short break during the workshop.\n\n\n2025-02-25-ucsb-ml\nThe instructors take the time to manually write the code and explain it line by line.\n\n\n2025-02-25-ucsb-ml\nThe hands-on learning was useful\n\n\n2025-02-25-ucsb-ml\nopening picture of what ML is and setup for environment and hand holding through typing\n\n\n2025-02-25-ucsb-ml\nGood continuation of the intro to data management in Python workshop. Gave a general/basic overview of machine learning. Kept things simple to facilitate a broad audience with varying experience in related topics.\n\n\n2025-02-25-ucsb-ml\nWell-Structured Content – The workshop followed a clear and logical progression, making it easy to build upon foundational concepts.; Engaging and Supportive Instructors – The instructors and helpers were knowledgeable, patient, and responsive to questions.; Hands-On Learning Approach – Practical coding exercises reinforced key machine learning concepts, allowing participants to apply what they learned immediately.; Accessible and Well-Prepared Materials – The provided resources, including notebooks and example datasets, were well-organized and easy to follow.; Encouraging Environment – The collaborative and inclusive atmosphere fostered engagement and active participation.\n\n\n2025-01-14-ucsb-python\nCovers a wide range of python functions and usage\n\n\n2025-01-14-ucsb-python\nnothing\n\n\n2025-01-14-ucsb-python\nComputer literacy!

For example, in some ggplots, we added titles and subtitles, but I would appreciate a deeper explanation of all of the options, perhaps by making one very fancy graph\n\n\n2025-01-23-ucsb-geospatial\nMore in-depth explanations of what is going on behind the scenes or detailed descriptions of rasters etc.\n\n\n2025-01-15-ucsb-containers\nMaybe one more little break\n\n\n2025-02-03-ucsb-computing\nI think the workshop did not do enough to demystify some of the work that goes into a user using one of these campus resources.\n\n\n2025-02-03-ucsb-computing\nA lot of information was given, but I feel that focusing on one specific resource and navigating it could have been more practical.\n\n\n2025-02-03-ucsb-computing\nThe last part of the workshop had a lot of things written in the slides, I don’t think it was that clear what we should take away from it.\n\n\n2025-02-03-ucsb-computing\nI wanted to go through the workflow of using supercomputers with an actual example of how to write code and submit a job to a cluster and see how the results were outputted\n\n\n2025-02-03-ucsb-computing\nExamples of past research projects that used these resources could add more context for each computing resource.\n\n\n2025-02-18-ucsb-intermediater\nI have a lot of experience with data analysis (in another coding language), so I was able to follow pretty closely what was going on. I felt like others might not have had as much experience, so they were lost as to what the goal of some of the commands were. It might be good to think carefully about where some people might not know what the goal of a command is. Perhaps you expect people to come in with that knowledge, which is fine, but it was the sense I got from some of the questions that were asked.\n\n\n2025-02-18-ucsb-intermediater\nif an instructor was coming from a non-coding background they might be able to present the material in a different way. Also it was hard for me to think about immediate applications for my data project. I would like to come prepared with my own data and write code that is pertinent, as i had a hard time making the leap of how I would apply it easily\n\n\n2025-02-18-ucsb-intermediater\nI think something that could be useful for folks to walk away with are more examples utilizing for loops, functions and if and else statements. So maybe, creating like a part 2 for the workshop to get into more details and examples.\n\n\n2025-02-25-ucsb-ml\nThe material itself could be improved. It would be helpful to go through a real life example from beginning to end without over simplifying the problem.\n\n\n2025-02-25-ucsb-ml\nI wish there was more about using ML for things other than handling large data sets. For example, as an engineer, I’m most interested in ML for design optimization. I know there’s lots of different implementations of this out there, so a review of the strengths and weaknesses of different ML paradigms would be useful\n\n\n2025-02-25-ucsb-ml\npacing felt weird? didn’t learn that much conceptual stuff or when we did it was very slow? Then typing I guess is not slow it’s fine, but sometimes the way we talked about the typing was slow, or rather inefficient/not fluid teaching wise. Like somehow more awkward than it should have been?\n\n\n2025-02-25-ucsb-ml\nI would have like to dive a little deeper into additional examples of machine learning. Perhaps using an additional dataset, or at least exploring the use of multiple predictor values rather than only the appache score. Some more basic code was overexplained, while the arguments of more advanced methods/functions related to the sci-kit library were kind of glossed over/rushed. Less time could be spent answering questions/comments from participants that weren’t really in the scope of what we’re learning. EX: spending 5-10 minutes to talk about whether certain predictor variables in the dataset were statistically sound to include because they are correlated with/calculated based on other predictor variables (we didn’t even end up using the variable of question and that participant didn’t even attend the second day).\n\n\n2025-02-25-ucsb-ml\n1. Pacing Adjustments – Some sections felt a bit fast-paced, especially for beginners. Providing additional time for complex topics could enhance understanding.; 2. More Real-World Case Studies – Including more practical, real-world examples of machine learning applications would help connect concepts to industry use cases.; 3. Pre-Workshop Preparation Materials – Offering optional pre-workshop readings or short tutorials could help participants with varying backgrounds start on the same level.; 4. More Breaks – Shorter but more frequent breaks could improve focus and prevent fatigue, especially during intensive coding sessions.; 5. Advanced Follow-Up Sessions – A follow-up session or additional resources for those who want to go beyond the basics would be beneficial.\n\n\n2025-01-14-ucsb-python\nN/A\n\n\n2025-01-14-ucsb-python\nI found the workshop to be very informative and engaging. However, one potential improvement could be providing more time for Q&A or group discussions to allow for deeper exploration of the topics. Additionally, having more interactive activities could enhance participant engagement\n\n\n2025-01-14-ucsb-python\nN/A\n\n\n2025-01-23-ucsb-geospatial\nmore days:)\n\n\n2025-01-23-ucsb-geospatial\nI would consider adding one more day, the last day felt a bit rushed in the last part. Explain the functions in more details, for instance, why we are using a function in a certain line – sometimes this was said, but not often.\n\n\n2025-01-23-ucsb-geospatial\nMore checkpoints through out the workshop\n\n\n2025-01-23-ucsb-geospatial\nExplain certain acronyms or functions a little better when we use them even if they were explained once a few days ago\n\n\n2025-01-23-ucsb-geospatial\nI think we should copy and paste code more often because it was a bit tedious especially with all the ggplot setup\n\n\n2025-01-15-ucsb-containers\na bit long, but seems necessary to be this long\n\n\n2025-02-03-ucsb-computing\nOn of the speakers spoke fast and was harder to follow and some words were unclear, I would say speak slower and distinctly.\n\n\n2025-02-03-ucsb-computing\nMaybe splitting up into groups for Q&A session for folks that had questions about CSC, HPC, data storage, etc.\n\n\n2025-01-15-ucsb-containers\nMore applied examples of how to work in a project with big data sets and share the projects.\n\n\n2025-02-18-ucsb-intermediater\nmore of them, evenings might also be good\n\n\n2025-02-18-ucsb-intermediater\nI understand the focus was on developing coding skills, but I hope in future lessons we’re able to follow through on the example to see the end result of the practical application for the skills we’ve learned."

It really helped to have people around that are comfortable with the software.\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nI liked that the instructors encouraged questions and were very patient.

Some of the helpers didn’t seem to be helping.\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nIm left slightly unsatisfied with how I would use these - it seems like maybe it would be easier to just open the folders and make changes directly but maybe there are times where you can’t do that? That extra context would be nice. I did learn a lot about file navigation though and that will be great for when I’m pushing and pulling to github on my terminal as before this workshop I wasn’t very effective at that navigation.\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nThe beginning of the workshop moved very quickly. It would be helpful especially during the start for beginners if the instructor paused so I could read the commands they typed before the executed the command.; Also, viewing the Windows interface was much easier than the mac because of the color coding, so I would have preferred to have seen that interface the entire time.\n\n\n2025-04-10-ucsb-shell\nIt’s hard to get the pace right. The first hour or so was awfully slow and then the more complicated stuff at the end was rushed.\n\n\n2025-04-10-ucsb-shell\nFor me, I have no background with the terminology. I think it is a great workshop but just harder for me since I was slower to understand the new information.\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nI had a hard time managing the ’ thumbs up’ feature when asked. I found I could either follow, or respond. Again, I need to invest in another screen which would make this easier. I have a tiny laptop screen.\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nI am not sure if it was beyond the scope of the workshop, but I thought it would have been helpful to see some applications of why I would use the shell instead of the GUI. I feel like the things I learned today (moving between directories, renaming files, copying files, etc.) I could’ve just done easier in the GUI.\n\n\n2025-04-14-ucsb-git\nNo notes!\n\n\n2025-04-14-ucsb-git\nThe workshop could be improved in the following ways (nonexhaustive):; ; - Be more prepared for student confusion, especially in a workshop advertised as being suitable for beginners.; - Instruct more clearly, using sentences that don’t require immediate caveats for fear of prompting a student to do something catastrophic to their computers; - Understand Git and GitHub more thoroughly. More than once, instructors confessed their ignorance about how to answer seemingly elementary questions about the programs. They seemed to know how to plug commands into Git but not how or why any of it worked.; – Explain the utility of Git and GitHub. The case for why or how these tools improve upon information management practices students might already be using was rarely made persuasively.; – Teach students how to protect their privacy from malicious actors. In an age of “cyber stalking,” “doxxing,” and grassroots fascist threats (and even violence) against people in higher education, I was frankly flabbergasted by the instructors’ devil-may-care attitude toward students connecting themselves to an open-access repository from which information seemingly cannot readily be deleted.; - Divest from tools that depend on Large Language Models (LLMs, sometimes spuriously called “AI”). UCSB is a university committed to learning, and no educational entity should encourage students to use plagiarism machines that discourage critical thinking.\n\n\n2025-04-16-ucsb-gitcollab\nIt was confusing and the end was rushed - I couldn’t tell what application was being used or how I would apply it\n\n\n2025-04-16-ucsb-gitcollab\n1) Grounding participants in task and workflow. There were different instruction materials and when lost or behind it was hard to determine which materials to use to get back on track.; 2) At times hard to concentrate on the instructor instructions due to many task and side conversations happening at once ; ; Maybe having one source of instruction or if there are multiple follow one and tell students which workshop material to follow since at times these instructions deviated and at times hard to tell which material was the default and at what point in time a different solution/ alternative method was being used.\n\n\n2025-04-16-ucsb-gitcollab\n1) Grounding participants in task and workflow.

Maybe focusing on developing or showing us how to build a cheatsheet of how to document where to list what diff packages are used for so we can refer to it quickly for interviews or our own work.\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nI think it was great. I liked the breaks in the middle.\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nSometimes it went a bit quickly, particularly when multiple lines of code were needed for an exercise. I was usually able to catch up though!\n\n\n2025-04-10-ucsb-shell\nReally slow\n\n\n2025-04-14-ucsb-git\nN/A\n\n\n2025-04-14-ucsb-git\nIt would be helpful if there was some time at the beginning to elaborate on some of the vocabulary (commits, staging, adds, etc).

More than once, instructors confessed their ignorance about how to answer seemingly elementary questions about the programs. They seemed to know how to plug commands into Git but not how or why any of it worked.; – Explain the utility of Git and GitHub. The case for why or how these tools improve upon information management practices students might already be using was rarely made persuasively.; – Teach students how to protect their privacy from malicious actors. In an age of “cyber stalking,” “doxxing,” and grassroots fascist threats (and even violence) against people in higher education, I was frankly flabbergasted by the instructors’ devil-may-care attitude toward students connecting themselves to an open-access repository from which information seemingly cannot readily be deleted.; - Divest from tools that depend on Large Language Models (LLMs, sometimes spuriously called “AI”). UCSB is a university committed to learning, and no educational entity should encourage students to use plagiarism machines that discourage critical thinking.\n\n\n2025-04-14-ucsb-git\nN/A\n\n\n2025-04-14-ucsb-git\nIt would be helpful if there was some time at the beginning to elaborate on some of the vocabulary (commits, staging, adds, etc). I felt like it wasn’t clear to me until the very end exactly what I was doing/trying to do. Also, I still do not feel clear on which of the setup steps of connecting GitBash to the online GitHub need to be completed during each start up of the software vs now it is setup and I do not need to recreate the keys.\n\n\n2025-04-14-ucsb-git\nlist of commands of Git"

I felt like others might not have had as much experience, so they were lost as to what the goal of some of the commands were. It might be good to think carefully about where some people might not know what the goal of a command is. Perhaps you expect people to come in with that knowledge, which is fine, but it was the sense I got from some of the questions that were asked.\n\n\n2025-02-18-ucsb-intermediater\nif an instructor was coming from a non-coding background they might be able to present the material in a different way. Also it was hard for me to think about immediate applications for my data project.

So maybe, creating like a part 2 for the workshop to get into more details and examples.\n\n\n2025-02-18-ucsb-intermediater\nmore of them, evenings might also be good\n\n\n2025-02-18-ucsb-intermediater\nI understand the focus was on developing coding skills, but I hope in future lessons we’re able to follow through on the example to see the end result of the practical application for the skills we’ve learned."

Thank you!\n\n\n2024-07-02-ucsb-spreadsheets\nI liked that you didn’t assume prior knowledge on the part of the participants. The sample data was easy to understand and work with. The pace was good, but I would have liked more tips. Perhaps an advanced spreadsheet workshop?\n\n\n2024-07-02-ucsb-spreadsheets\nThe instructors were very knowledgeable. Having additional instructors to help out if you got stuck while working on the exercises was really great! It was engaging the whole time.\n\n\n2024-07-02-ucsb-spreadsheets\nInstructors very helpful, had a good flow, and were very clear.\n\n\n2024-07-02-ucsb-spreadsheets\nAwesome job using the microphone and ensuring the font size of the content shown on the main screen was enlarged. They’re accessibility basics, but they’re often forgotten.\n\n\n2024-07-02-ucsb-spreadsheets\nThe instructors made a daunting area of knowledge very accessible and showing practical applications.\n\n\n2024-07-02-ucsb-spreadsheets\nmaking sure everyone was understanding and on the same page as the instructor;\n\n\n2024-07-02-ucsb-spreadsheets\nThe instructors were ready to help at every moment\n\n\n2024-07-02-ucsb-spreadsheets\nin-person, hands-on. VERY, very helpful in the learning of this material.\n\n\n2024-07-02-ucsb-spreadsheets\npre workshop information helped everyone starting the workshop\n\n\n2024-07-02-ucsb-spreadsheets\nI liked the exercises and the ability to ask questions in class at any time.\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nThe people were patient and weren’t condescending. They respected the questions that were asked\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nGood accessibility / free workshop\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nI liked being challenged to learn on my own at some points\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nMultiple instructors; this allowed “floaters” to help those struggling rather than the whole class getting caught up.\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nGreat workshop for beginners. Instructors were very helpful and attentive when students needed help. I took this course because I wanted to learn how to do a specific task in python that was outside of the scope of this class, but the instructors provided a good foundation for me to start the project on my own.\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nI think the tutorials were a major strength of the workshop\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nscreens on every desk so everyone can follow along\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nIt is general, so people of any discipline can participate and learn.; It starts with the basics and builds up.\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nIt is general, so people of any discipline can participate and learn.; It starts with the basics and builds up.\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nFrequency and access"

I feel like I didn’t exit the workshop with many hard skills, but rather a general improvement in background knowledge about data in spreadsheets (which is helpful, don’t get me wrong!) and that the coding workshops will help me to transition that new knowledge into practice.\n\n\n2024-07-02-ucsb-spreadsheets\nclearly stating keyboard shortcuts they are using for people who dont know them\n\n\n2024-07-02-ucsb-spreadsheets\nPreparing registrants to bring a laptop\n\n\n2024-07-02-ucsb-spreadsheets\nContinue with the length of time.

There were a few times where the instructors broke down the code, explaining what each piece did and that was AWESOME! I wish the whole class would’ve been like that. But most of the time, it was like just watching somebody code. I had no idea why they were typing the things they were typing. I felt like a monkey, just typing whatever the instructors typed with 0% understanding of why I was typing it.\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nI wish there had been a little more challenges in class. Or, it might be a good idea to assign a challenge as homework.\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nIt was unclear where to find the reading materials and learning module and that we are expected to keep up with those materials. There was no following along between the in-class learning and what was in the reading materials on the site because it was never referenced (we’re now on page ‘blah’).\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nAt times it was difficult to follow and I wasn’t always sure how I could apply what I learned to my work after the workshop. Or why we were learning the particular things we were working on in the course. ; ; ; Since this course is a “data analysis and visualization” class I think it would be best to have the workshop follow a small project. Get some datasets where the population is people instead of animals. And, work together to answer a very simple but specific research question throughout the course and generate some graphs at the end.\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nI think less time reviewing the previous weeks material would improve the workshop\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nslower at some points\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nWe lost time in all sessions because people were lost on where they had organized their files, so maybe thinking of a more general and accessible way to managing folders and files can be useful\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nWe lost time in all sessions because people were lost on where they had organized their files, so maybe thinking of a more general and accessible way to managing folders and files can be useful\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nMaybe applied into a single project so there’s one thread of logic (instead of broken up into chunks). But thats how I feel, may not be possible."

We will not be covering…”)\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nSometimes, terminal commands and flags can be cryptic; I think it would be helpful to explain what each flag means (especially when doing the ssh part) so that those who want to can appreciate what’s being done.\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nI wish that this workshop (and others) could have a demo of a real-world use case. It’s all well and good to learn the very basics, but then when I think about applying this to my workflow or to existing collaborations I have I can’t even picture what it would look like. If the last 30 minutes could have been a demo with a more complex set of files and a larger slate of collaborators, that would be good.\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nSome other students mentioned “branching” as a topic they want to be covered, which might warrant a third day for the workshop\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nThe pace was a little fast at first, but then it got better\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nLonger, mor github functions taught\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nI hope you could provide us with the full learning materials that we can look back in the future in form of a pdf or something like that.\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nA summary of the material covered after the workshop\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nFor the scope of the topic the workshop was perfect. Lots of possibilities for advanced beginner workshops–working on our own stuff with instructor support, learning about branches, best practices for collaborative work come to mind. Could probably fit 15 min of the latter into this one, since it went a little short. (better a little short than a little long tho.)"

I mention this because I think the topic of version control can be very confusing to newcomers. For people who are brand new to the whole topic, who I believe would be the target audience, I think it might be helpful to spend more time at the beginning going over what version control is about and the benefits of using it. You already do this, but I would expand out on it.\n\n\n2024-01-30-ucsb-git\nMake it more clear what programs need to be downloaded and installed prior to the workshop."

The instructors/helpers dealt with students’ questions immediately in various ways during the session (i.e., chat room, workshop room.

It’s kinda hot and stuffy inside the room.\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nmaking sure that they are familiar with the lesson and exactly what they are going to show and that there aren’t any issues before they lead the lesson. When the instructors got confused or made mistakes and had to try to fix them, it made learning already confusing things even more confusing because I was lost on what was a mistake and what was correct. In general, I believe it went a little too fast for me\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nNot jumping around directories quickly\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nBetter coordination between instructors if other instructors need to interrupt the instructor currently teaching to better explain a point or answer a question\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nClearer syllabus and more exercises\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nBreak time can come a little soon.\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\ngrep gets a little complicated with escape characters, I think those could be added to the workshop\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nnone\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nsharing instructors use for bash-shell and participants briefly sharing relevance to their own work (I mostly work in rstudio on datasets, or morphing datasets into better datasets, I rarely work with tons of files…)\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nI found it particularly difficult to follow along in this hybrid course. Perhaps the workbook and course flow should be reorganized. Or having a cheatsheet available of commands we have learned so far so participants don’t have to scroll through the workbook endlessly when trying to solve a challenge. I think a fully online course would work much better (since I can’t attend in person, but grateful to have access to these courses working remotely, so I’ll take whatever you can swing!). One of the instructors shell was color coded, which was sooo much easier to follow along even though its not what my own shell looks like. Maybe multiple shell windows up at the same time so when working in nano the previous commands are still available for those who are a step or two behind. I think it would be great to emphasize somewhere in the course why command line is still important when working on modern computers. Looking forward to the next course, thanks!\n\n\n2022-07-19-ucsb-git\nGreat workshop but it might help if the instructors do not go too fast sometimes since we need to execute commands. Thank you!\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nIt would be super helpful if there was an additional day allotted to this workshop as we were unable to cover everything as planned.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\n’- There were a few uncertainties in the material taught on the 2nd day; - Some parts of the workshop were a bit fast paced; - There were a few technical difficulties on zoom in the beginning (but they were resolved in the end);\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nEverything was good. thank you.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nPerhaps providing the scripts ahead or time or afterward so that we can re-do the lessons at our leisure after the workshop.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nwould have liked to learn how to import data (e.g., from csv files, etc) to work with.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nI think some of the instructors that are not teaching at the moment should be monitoring the room a bit more. I was stuck and put up my pink sticky note, but didn’t get help until the break.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nn/a;\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nNot all instructors had a strong grasp on R, which caused some slow-downs and also caused some confusing presentation of the material. ; ; It would also be useful if the instructors presented clear and self-constrained scripts in these lessons (i.e. how one would actually organize scripts in their own work). This was done inconsistently across trainers, and there were some errors in how the scripts were managed. For example, it would be useful to tell the learners that it is important to clear your environment between scripts and to make sure that objects referenced only in previous scripts are not used in your current script.\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nN/A\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nbetter timing - although instructor commented that they rarely get through the whole thing; or plan more realistic timing goals\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nAs someone fairly new to R, perhaps a longer class (more days) to go through the lessons slower, step by step. I can do this on my own now, but it would have been nice to have more time to learn the steps. Sometimes I would have an error in my typing that took me awhile to catch and fix and by then the workshop had moved on. I was usually able to catch up or fix it later by redoing the lesson in my own timeframe.\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nincluding a quick tutorial video on the set-up page for how to get the data up n running before may help alleviate some of the issues that required troubleshooting at the beginning of the workshop\n\n\n2022-08-16-ucsb-machlearn-r\nit’s always a struggle, especially in piloted workshops, to have a good balance between getting through the planned material and allowing enough time in the workshops to provide necessary background/context info and answer questions. The first day was paced a bit fast, but we made it through the material; the second day accommodated more time for explanations, but we did not make it through the material."

It’s kinda hot and stuffy inside the room.\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nmaking sure that they are familiar with the lesson and exactly what they are going to show and that there aren’t any issues before they lead the lesson. When the instructors got confused or made mistakes and had to try to fix them, it made learning already confusing things even more confusing because I was lost on what was a mistake and what was correct. In general, I believe it went a little too fast for me\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nNot jumping around directories quickly\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nBetter coordination between instructors if other instructors need to interrupt the instructor currently teaching to better explain a point or answer a question\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nClearer syllabus and more exercises\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nBreak time can come a little soon.\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\ngrep gets a little complicated with escape characters, I think those could be added to the workshop\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nnone\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nsharing instructors use for bash-shell and participants briefly sharing relevance to their own work (I mostly work in rstudio on datasets, or morphing datasets into better datasets, I rarely work with tons of files…)\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nI found it particularly difficult to follow along in this hybrid course. Perhaps the workbook and course flow should be reorganized. Or having a cheatsheet available of commands we have learned so far so participants don’t have to scroll through the workbook endlessly when trying to solve a challenge. I think a fully online course would work much better (since I can’t attend in person, but grateful to have access to these courses working remotely, so I’ll take whatever you can swing!). One of the instructors shell was color coded, which was sooo much easier to follow along even though its not what my own shell looks like. Maybe multiple shell windows up at the same time so when working in nano the previous commands are still available for those who are a step or two behind. I think it would be great to emphasize somewhere in the course why command line is still important when working on modern computers. Looking forward to the next course, thanks!\n\n\n2022-07-19-ucsb-git\nGreat workshop but it might help if the instructors do not go too fast sometimes since we need to execute commands. Thank you!\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nIt would be super helpful if there was an additional day allotted to this workshop as we were unable to cover everything as planned.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\n’- There were a few uncertainties in the material taught on the 2nd day; - Some parts of the workshop were a bit fast paced; - There were a few technical difficulties on zoom in the beginning (but they were resolved in the end);\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nEverything was good. thank you.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nPerhaps providing the scripts ahead or time or afterward so that we can re-do the lessons at our leisure after the workshop.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nwould have liked to learn how to import data (e.g., from csv files, etc) to work with.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nI think some of the instructors that are not teaching at the moment should be monitoring the room a bit more. I was stuck and put up my pink sticky note, but didn’t get help until the break.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nn/a;\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nNot all instructors had a strong grasp on R, which caused some slow-downs and also caused some confusing presentation of the material. ; ; It would also be useful if the instructors presented clear and self-constrained scripts in these lessons (i.e. how one would actually organize scripts in their own work). This was done inconsistently across trainers, and there were some errors in how the scripts were managed. For example, it would be useful to tell the learners that it is important to clear your environment between scripts and to make sure that objects referenced only in previous scripts are not used in your current script.\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nN/A\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nbetter timing - although instructor commented that they rarely get through the whole thing; or plan more realistic timing goals\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nAs someone fairly new to R, perhaps a longer class (more days) to go through the lessons slower, step by step. I can do this on my own now, but it would have been nice to have more time to learn the steps. Sometimes I would have an error in my typing that took me awhile to catch and fix and by then the workshop had moved on. I was usually able to catch up or fix it later by redoing the lesson in my own timeframe.\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nincluding a quick tutorial video on the set-up page for how to get the data up n running before may help alleviate some of the issues that required troubleshooting at the beginning of the workshop\n\n\n2022-08-16-ucsb-machlearn-r\nit’s always a struggle, especially in piloted workshops, to have a good balance between getting through the planned material and allowing enough time in the workshops to provide necessary background/context info and answer questions. The first day was paced a bit fast, but we made it through the material; the second day accommodated more time for explanations, but we did not make it through the material."

I felt I got a lot more out of it.\n\n\n2022-10-18-ucsb-bash-git\nmaybe more effective ad for more students to attend. also, sometimes it just hard to find a free schedule for 3 consecutive days for students.\n\n\n2022-10-18-ucsb-bash-git\nIt was sad it almost got cancelled! Some advertisement improvements could be made to ensure at least a slightly larger attendance. At least enough to make it financially viable\n\n\n2022-10-18-ucsb-bash-git\nThe workshop was great. More time with the instructors– another day or two– would have been valuable. For additional hands on experience with some of the concepts and to dig into more sophisticated aspects of those."

Perhaps the workbook and course flow should be reorganized. Or having a cheatsheet available of commands we have learned so far so participants don’t have to scroll through the workbook endlessly when trying to solve a challenge. I think a fully online course would work much better (since I can’t attend in person, but grateful to have access to these courses working remotely, so I’ll take whatever you can swing!). One of the instructors shell was color coded, which was sooo much easier to follow along even though its not what my own shell looks like. Maybe multiple shell windows up at the same time so when working in nano the previous commands are still available for those who are a step or two behind. I think it would be great to emphasize somewhere in the course why command line is still important when working on modern computers. Looking forward to the next course, thanks!"

I think it could be shortened to 2-3 hours. Or instead, maybe provide a detailed schedule of what topics will be discussed, because I didn’t really need the first 30-40 min of the first workshop (I knew how HTML worked already, more or less) and was a bit disengaged during it. It’s difficult to accommodate different skill/knowledge levels and the workshop did that by going from the ground up with basics, which is nice if I were someone that needed that, I’m just not.; ; More about the length of the workshop: I did have to skip class to attend, though there are always trade-offs with scheduling at other times too. Making the workshop shorter would alleviate some schedule conflicts though.\n\n\n2024-11-05-ucsb-webscraping\nmore detailed.\n\n\n2024-11-05-ucsb-webscraping\nmore discussion time\n\n\n2024-11-05-ucsb-webscraping\nI believe we all have different projects in mind.

We will not be covering…”)\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nSometimes, terminal commands and flags can be cryptic; I think it would be helpful to explain what each flag means (especially when doing the ssh part) so that those who want to can appreciate what’s being done.\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nI wish that this workshop (and others) could have a demo of a real-world use case. It’s all well and good to learn the very basics, but then when I think about applying this to my workflow or to existing collaborations I have I can’t even picture what it would look like. If the last 30 minutes could have been a demo with a more complex set of files and a larger slate of collaborators, that would be good.\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nSome other students mentioned “branching” as a topic they want to be covered, which might warrant a third day for the workshop\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nThe pace was a little fast at first, but then it got better\n\n\n2024-11-05-ucsb-webscraping\nI mainly felt like it was a bit long, 4 hours spread out over two days. I think it could be shortened to 2-3 hours. Or instead, maybe provide a detailed schedule of what topics will be discussed, because I didn’t really need the first 30-40 min of the first workshop (I knew how HTML worked already, more or less) and was a bit disengaged during it. It’s difficult to accommodate different skill/knowledge levels and the workshop did that by going from the ground up with basics, which is nice if I were someone that needed that, I’m just not.; ; More about the length of the workshop: I did have to skip class to attend, though there are always trade-offs with scheduling at other times too. Making the workshop shorter would alleviate some schedule conflicts though.\n\n\n2024-10-08-ucsb-r\nBreaks could be sooner like an hour 10 minutes in\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nLonger, mor github functions taught\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nI hope you could provide us with the full learning materials that we can look back in the future in form of a pdf or something like that.\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nA summary of the material covered after the workshop\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nFor the scope of the topic the workshop was perfect. Lots of possibilities for advanced beginner workshops–working on our own stuff with instructor support, learning about branches, best practices for collaborative work come to mind. Could probably fit 15 min of the latter into this one, since it went a little short. (better a little short than a little long tho.)\n\n\n2024-11-05-ucsb-webscraping\nmore detailed.\n\n\n2024-11-05-ucsb-webscraping\nmore discussion time\n\n\n2024-11-05-ucsb-webscraping\nI believe we all have different projects in mind. It would be nice if we can look at our own webpage that we are interested in and extract some data using the tools we have learned from the workshop."

As I reflect on my graduate studies as a fifth-year, I wish I had been better set up for success in terms of organization in the beginning, but I just didn’t know better (nor did my advisor)\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nTerminal commands\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nI’m looking for a workshop that teaches how to create and modify a makefile\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nWorking with R (or Python) and GitHub instead of .md files\n\n\n2024-11-05-ucsb-webscraping\nvideo editing, LaTeX\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nTransferring between languages (we learn a lot of R but I know a lot of the working world uses python)\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\n- Basics of Object Oriented Programming\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nIntroduction & Intermediate workshop on Linux\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nsee previous answer re git workshops. i’d also like to learn about working with APIs.\n\n\n2024-11-05-ucsb-webscraping\nNo suggestions"

Having multiple instructors and helpers was also a plus.\n\n\n2024-05-01-ucsb-r\nThe number of instructors.\n\n\n2024-05-01-ucsb-r\njUPYTERHUB (having one more alternative platform to use rstudio), helpers, and instructors were well organized.\n\n\n2024-05-01-ucsb-r\nexercises, enthusiastic instructors, good pacing, materials available online\n\n\n2024-05-01-ucsb-r\ndirect application to a variety of disciplines. We all need to clean and plot data, no matter the subject\n\n\n2024-05-01-ucsb-r\nversatile - data wrangling and some data visualization\n\n\n2024-06-04-ucsb-containers\nClarity, well organized\n\n\n2024-06-04-ucsb-containers\nHands-on activities and comfortable pace and very friendly instructor and helpers.\n\n\n2024-06-04-ucsb-containers\nClear and well paced instructions\n\n\n2024-06-04-ucsb-containers\nThe instructions list was extremely helpful\n\n\n2024-06-04-ucsb-containers\nUseful\n\n\n2024-06-04-ucsb-containers\nThis was the clearest explanation I have had on working in containers. Thank you!; Valued opportunities to ask questions - especially valued the instructor+helpers walking around and helping individuals to troubleshoot if needed.; I valued the end-resources as well — links to ACCESS and info on how to request cloud resources there.; The workshop was accessible to participants at a variety of skill/experience levels.\n\n\n2024-06-10-ucsb-geospatial\nAccessibility\n\n\n2024-06-10-ucsb-geospatial\nGood intro to lots of things\n\n\n2024-06-10-ucsb-geospatial\ndirect application for spatial plotting in R.\n\n\n2024-06-10-ucsb-geospatial\nBeginner friendly, slow pace, easy to work with data\n\n\n2024-06-10-ucsb-geospatial\nThe lessons are clear and easy to follow"

Two days are not enough.\n\n\n2024-05-01-ucsb-r\nI attended most part of the first day and all was good!\n\n\n2024-05-01-ucsb-r\nmore exercises interspersed throughout would be helpful\n\n\n2024-05-01-ucsb-r\nmaybe time to practice with our own datasets\n\n\n2024-05-01-ucsb-r\npersonally, i’d like entire day on data visualization, separate day for data wrangling\n\n\n2024-06-04-ucsb-containers\nshorter\n\n\n2024-06-04-ucsb-containers\nI would value more information on interacting with your desktop/data storage location. For example, best practices in uploading data and downloading results, including addressing privacy issues if the data are confidential.\n\n\n2024-06-10-ucsb-geospatial\nIt’s more helpful to have the instructor walk through the lecture than than jumping around.\n\n\n2024-06-10-ucsb-geospatial\nStreamline the second day\n\n\n2024-06-10-ucsb-geospatial\nGood that we can plot vector and raster data, but making it look good with a basemap, good color palette, scale bar(?), north arrow(?), and line sizing would be more beneficial.\n\n\n2024-06-10-ucsb-geospatial\nGo through a bit faster / cover more content. Or offer two sections (one for beginners and one for intermediate)\n\n\n2024-06-10-ucsb-geospatial\nI think that people who have not worked with R before could benefit from a brief introduction on ggplot geoms and aesthetics"

I felt like others might not have had as much experience, so they were lost as to what the goal of some of the commands were. It might be good to think carefully about where some people might not know what the goal of a command is. Perhaps you expect people to come in with that knowledge, which is fine, but it was the sense I got from some of the questions that were asked.\n\n\n2025-02-18-ucsb-intermediater\nif an instructor was coming from a non-coding background they might be able to present the material in a different way. Also it was hard for me to think about immediate applications for my data project. I would like to come prepared with my own data and write code that is pertinent, as i had a hard time making the leap of how I would apply it easily\n\n\n2025-02-18-ucsb-intermediater\nI think something that could be useful for folks to walk away with are more examples utilizing for loops, functions and if and else statements. So maybe, creating like a part 2 for the workshop to get into more details and examples.\n\n\n2025-02-18-ucsb-intermediater\nmore of them, evenings might also be good\n\n\n2025-02-18-ucsb-intermediater\nI understand the focus was on developing coding skills, but I hope in future lessons we’re able to follow through on the example to see the end result of the practical application for the skills we’ve learned."

Some of the instructors who weren’t directly presenting were still able to provide helpful input on the potential applications of workshop materials to additional fields of research.\n\n\n2025-02-25-ucsb-ml\nOne of the instructors provided a clear and concise explanation of a complex machine learning concept by breaking it down into smaller steps. For example, when covering decision trees, they used a real-world analogy related to everyday decision-making, which made it much easier to understand. Additionally, a helper guided me through debugging a coding error, ensuring I grasped the logic behind the solution rather than just fixing the issue. Their support significantly enhanced my learning experience."

It would be helpful to go through a real life example from beginning to end without over simplifying the problem.\n\n\n2025-02-25-ucsb-ml\nI wish there was more about using ML for things other than handling large data sets. For example, as an engineer, I’m most interested in ML for design optimization. I know there’s lots of different implementations of this out there, so a review of the strengths and weaknesses of different ML paradigms would be useful\n\n\n2025-02-25-ucsb-ml\npacing felt weird? didn’t learn that much conceptual stuff or when we did it was very slow? Then typing I guess is not slow it’s fine, but sometimes the way we talked about the typing was slow, or rather inefficient/not fluid teaching wise. Like somehow more awkward than it should have been?\n\n\n2025-02-25-ucsb-ml\nI would have like to dive a little deeper into additional examples of machine learning. Perhaps using an additional dataset, or at least exploring the use of multiple predictor values rather than only the appache score. Some more basic code was overexplained, while the arguments of more advanced methods/functions related to the sci-kit library were kind of glossed over/rushed. Less time could be spent answering questions/comments from participants that weren’t really in the scope of what we’re learning. EX: spending 5-10 minutes to talk about whether certain predictor variables in the dataset were statistically sound to include because they are correlated with/calculated based on other predictor variables (we didn’t even end up using the variable of question and that participant didn’t even attend the second day).\n\n\n2025-02-25-ucsb-ml\n1. Pacing Adjustments – Some sections felt a bit fast-paced, especially for beginners. Providing additional time for complex topics could enhance understanding.; 2. More Real-World Case Studies – Including more practical, real-world examples of machine learning applications would help connect concepts to industry use cases.; 3. Pre-Workshop Preparation Materials – Offering optional pre-workshop readings or short tutorials could help participants with varying backgrounds start on the same level.; 4. More Breaks – Shorter but more frequent breaks could improve focus and prevent fatigue, especially during intensive coding sessions.; 5. Advanced Follow-Up Sessions – A follow-up session or additional resources for those who want to go beyond the basics would be beneficial."

That extra context would be nice. I did learn a lot about file navigation though and that will be great for when I’m pushing and pulling to github on my terminal as before this workshop I wasn’t very effective at that navigation.\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nThe beginning of the workshop moved very quickly. It would be helpful especially during the start for beginners if the instructor paused so I could read the commands they typed before the executed the command.; Also, viewing the Windows interface was much easier than the mac because of the color coding, so I would have preferred to have seen that interface the entire time.\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nI had a hard time managing the ’ thumbs up’ feature when asked. I found I could either follow, or respond. Again, I need to invest in another screen which would make this easier. I have a tiny laptop screen.\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nI am not sure if it was beyond the scope of the workshop, but I thought it would have been helpful to see some applications of why I would use the shell instead of the GUI. I feel like the things I learned today (moving between directories, renaming files, copying files, etc.) I could’ve just done easier in the GUI.\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nI think it was great. I liked the breaks in the middle.\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nSometimes it went a bit quickly, particularly when multiple lines of code were needed for an exercise. I was usually able to catch up though!"
