For example, in some ggplots, we added titles and subtitles, but I would appreciate a deeper explanation of all of the options, perhaps by making one very fancy graph\n\n\n2025-01-23-ucsb-geospatial\nMore in-depth explanations of what is going on behind the scenes or detailed descriptions of rasters etc.\n\n\n2025-01-15-ucsb-containers\nMaybe one more little break\n\n\n2025-02-03-ucsb-computing\nI think the workshop did not do enough to demystify some of the work that goes into a user using one of these campus resources.\n\n\n2025-02-03-ucsb-computing\nA lot of information was given, but I feel that focusing on one specific resource and navigating it could have been more practical.\n\n\n2025-02-03-ucsb-computing\nThe last part of the workshop had a lot of things written in the slides, I don’t think it was that clear what we should take away from it.\n\n\n2025-02-03-ucsb-computing\nI wanted to go through the workflow of using supercomputers with an actual example of how to write code and submit a job to a cluster and see how the results were outputted\n\n\n2025-02-03-ucsb-computing\nExamples of past research projects that used these resources could add more context for each computing resource.\n\n\n2025-02-18-ucsb-intermediater\nI have a lot of experience with data analysis (in another coding language), so I was able to follow pretty closely what was going on. I felt like others might not have had as much experience, so they were lost as to what the goal of some of the commands were. It might be good to think carefully about where some people might not know what the goal of a command is. Perhaps you expect people to come in with that knowledge, which is fine, but it was the sense I got from some of the questions that were asked.\n\n\n2025-02-18-ucsb-intermediater\nif an instructor was coming from a non-coding background they might be able to present the material in a different way. Also it was hard for me to think about immediate applications for my data project. I would like to come prepared with my own data and write code that is pertinent, as i had a hard time making the leap of how I would apply it easily\n\n\n2025-02-18-ucsb-intermediater\nI think something that could be useful for folks to walk away with are more examples utilizing for loops, functions and if and else statements. So maybe, creating like a part 2 for the workshop to get into more details and examples.\n\n\n2025-02-25-ucsb-ml\nThe material itself could be improved. It would be helpful to go through a real life example from beginning to end without over simplifying the problem.\n\n\n2025-02-25-ucsb-ml\nI wish there was more about using ML for things other than handling large data sets. For example, as an engineer, I’m most interested in ML for design optimization. I know there’s lots of different implementations of this out there, so a review of the strengths and weaknesses of different ML paradigms would be useful\n\n\n2025-02-25-ucsb-ml\npacing felt weird? didn’t learn that much conceptual stuff or when we did it was very slow? Then typing I guess is not slow it’s fine, but sometimes the way we talked about the typing was slow, or rather inefficient/not fluid teaching wise. Like somehow more awkward than it should have been?\n\n\n2025-02-25-ucsb-ml\nI would have like to dive a little deeper into additional examples of machine learning. Perhaps using an additional dataset, or at least exploring the use of multiple predictor values rather than only the appache score. Some more basic code was overexplained, while the arguments of more advanced methods/functions related to the sci-kit library were kind of glossed over/rushed. Less time could be spent answering questions/comments from participants that weren’t really in the scope of what we’re learning. EX: spending 5-10 minutes to talk about whether certain predictor variables in the dataset were statistically sound to include because they are correlated with/calculated based on other predictor variables (we didn’t even end up using the variable of question and that participant didn’t even attend the second day).\n\n\n2025-02-25-ucsb-ml\n1. Pacing Adjustments – Some sections felt a bit fast-paced, especially for beginners. Providing additional time for complex topics could enhance understanding.; 2. More Real-World Case Studies – Including more practical, real-world examples of machine learning applications would help connect concepts to industry use cases.; 3. Pre-Workshop Preparation Materials – Offering optional pre-workshop readings or short tutorials could help participants with varying backgrounds start on the same level.; 4. More Breaks – Shorter but more frequent breaks could improve focus and prevent fatigue, especially during intensive coding sessions.; 5. Advanced Follow-Up Sessions – A follow-up session or additional resources for those who want to go beyond the basics would be beneficial.\n\n\n2025-01-14-ucsb-python\nN/A\n\n\n2025-01-14-ucsb-python\nI found the workshop to be very informative and engaging. However, one potential improvement could be providing more time for Q&A or group discussions to allow for deeper exploration of the topics. Additionally, having more interactive activities could enhance participant engagement\n\n\n2025-01-14-ucsb-python\nN/A\n\n\n2025-01-23-ucsb-geospatial\nmore days:)\n\n\n2025-01-23-ucsb-geospatial\nI would consider adding one more day, the last day felt a bit rushed in the last part. Explain the functions in more details, for instance, why we are using a function in a certain line – sometimes this was said, but not often.\n\n\n2025-01-23-ucsb-geospatial\nMore checkpoints through out the workshop\n\n\n2025-01-23-ucsb-geospatial\nExplain certain acronyms or functions a little better when we use them even if they were explained once a few days ago\n\n\n2025-01-23-ucsb-geospatial\nI think we should copy and paste code more often because it was a bit tedious especially with all the ggplot setup\n\n\n2025-01-15-ucsb-containers\na bit long, but seems necessary to be this long\n\n\n2025-02-03-ucsb-computing\nOn of the speakers spoke fast and was harder to follow and some words were unclear, I would say speak slower and distinctly.\n\n\n2025-02-03-ucsb-computing\nMaybe splitting up into groups for Q&A session for folks that had questions about CSC, HPC, data storage, etc.\n\n\n2025-01-15-ucsb-containers\nMore applied examples of how to work in a project with big data sets and share the projects.\n\n\n2025-02-18-ucsb-intermediater\nmore of them, evenings might also be good\n\n\n2025-02-18-ucsb-intermediater\nI understand the focus was on developing coding skills, but I hope in future lessons we’re able to follow through on the example to see the end result of the practical application for the skills we’ve learned."

Some of the helpers didn’t seem to be helping.\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nIm left slightly unsatisfied with how I would use these - it seems like maybe it would be easier to just open the folders and make changes directly but maybe there are times where you can’t do that? That extra context would be nice. I did learn a lot about file navigation though and that will be great for when I’m pushing and pulling to github on my terminal as before this workshop I wasn’t very effective at that navigation.\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nThe beginning of the workshop moved very quickly. It would be helpful especially during the start for beginners if the instructor paused so I could read the commands they typed before the executed the command.; Also, viewing the Windows interface was much easier than the mac because of the color coding, so I would have preferred to have seen that interface the entire time.\n\n\n2025-04-10-ucsb-shell\nIt’s hard to get the pace right. The first hour or so was awfully slow and then the more complicated stuff at the end was rushed.\n\n\n2025-04-10-ucsb-shell\nFor me, I have no background with the terminology. I think it is a great workshop but just harder for me since I was slower to understand the new information.\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nI had a hard time managing the ’ thumbs up’ feature when asked. I found I could either follow, or respond. Again, I need to invest in another screen which would make this easier. I have a tiny laptop screen.\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nI am not sure if it was beyond the scope of the workshop, but I thought it would have been helpful to see some applications of why I would use the shell instead of the GUI. I feel like the things I learned today (moving between directories, renaming files, copying files, etc.) I could’ve just done easier in the GUI.\n\n\n2025-04-14-ucsb-git\nNo notes!\n\n\n2025-04-14-ucsb-git\nThe workshop could be improved in the following ways (nonexhaustive):; ; - Be more prepared for student confusion, especially in a workshop advertised as being suitable for beginners.; - Instruct more clearly, using sentences that don’t require immediate caveats for fear of prompting a student to do something catastrophic to their computers; - Understand Git and GitHub more thoroughly. More than once, instructors confessed their ignorance about how to answer seemingly elementary questions about the programs. They seemed to know how to plug commands into Git but not how or why any of it worked.; – Explain the utility of Git and GitHub. The case for why or how these tools improve upon information management practices students might already be using was rarely made persuasively.; – Teach students how to protect their privacy from malicious actors. In an age of “cyber stalking,” “doxxing,” and grassroots fascist threats (and even violence) against people in higher education, I was frankly flabbergasted by the instructors’ devil-may-care attitude toward students connecting themselves to an open-access repository from which information seemingly cannot readily be deleted.; - Divest from tools that depend on Large Language Models (LLMs, sometimes spuriously called “AI”). UCSB is a university committed to learning, and no educational entity should encourage students to use plagiarism machines that discourage critical thinking.\n\n\n2025-04-16-ucsb-gitcollab\nIt was confusing and the end was rushed - I couldn’t tell what application was being used or how I would apply it\n\n\n2025-04-16-ucsb-gitcollab\n1) Grounding participants in task and workflow. There were different instruction materials and when lost or behind it was hard to determine which materials to use to get back on track.; 2) At times hard to concentrate on the instructor instructions due to many task and side conversations happening at once ; ; Maybe having one source of instruction or if there are multiple follow one and tell students which workshop material to follow since at times these instructions deviated and at times hard to tell which material was the default and at what point in time a different solution/ alternative method was being used.\n\n\n2025-04-16-ucsb-gitcollab\n1) Grounding participants in task and workflow.

I’m not sure how it could be improved - it was a start.\n\n\n2025-04-29-ucsb-computing\nhaving interactive examples\n\n\n2025-05-01-ucsb-r\nmaybe more on data that we get to see first where it is coming from\n\n\n2025-05-01-ucsb-r\nWhen I look at internships for social science research, they ask for knowledge of specific packages… tidyverse, ggplot are super common. Maybe focusing on developing or showing us how to build a cheatsheet of how to document where to list what diff packages are used for so we can refer to it quickly for interviews or our own work.\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nI think it was great. I liked the breaks in the middle.\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nSometimes it went a bit quickly, particularly when multiple lines of code were needed for an exercise. I was usually able to catch up though!\n\n\n2025-04-10-ucsb-shell\nReally slow\n\n\n2025-04-14-ucsb-git\nN/A\n\n\n2025-04-14-ucsb-git\nIt would be helpful if there was some time at the beginning to elaborate on some of the vocabulary (commits, staging, adds, etc). I felt like it wasn’t clear to me until the very end exactly what I was doing/trying to do. Also, I still do not feel clear on which of the setup steps of connecting GitBash to the online GitHub need to be completed during each start up of the software vs now it is setup and I do not need to recreate the keys.\n\n\n2025-04-14-ucsb-git\nlist of commands of Git\n\n\n2025-04-16-ucsb-gitcollab\nGiving more time for breaks\n\n\n2025-04-29-ucsb-computing\nPeople typically program in one language, not mixing the programming language would be better. Longer workshop with hands on exercise would be helpful when describing the HPC resource and parallel computing.\n\n\n2025-04-29-ucsb-computing\nConsider restructuring this series: all R users, all jupyter users, etc. I only use R for my research, so a more thorough workshop on how to accomplish these tasks using R would have been more beneficial than just the first few minutes of the workshop.\n\n\n2025-04-29-ucsb-computing\nmore complete walk-through of preparing, submitting, and receiving results from a job\n\n\n2025-05-01-ucsb-r\nsometimes im confused by what each function means"

More than once, instructors confessed their ignorance about how to answer seemingly elementary questions about the programs. They seemed to know how to plug commands into Git but not how or why any of it worked.; – Explain the utility of Git and GitHub. The case for why or how these tools improve upon information management practices students might already be using was rarely made persuasively.; – Teach students how to protect their privacy from malicious actors. In an age of “cyber stalking,” “doxxing,” and grassroots fascist threats (and even violence) against people in higher education, I was frankly flabbergasted by the instructors’ devil-may-care attitude toward students connecting themselves to an open-access repository from which information seemingly cannot readily be deleted.; - Divest from tools that depend on Large Language Models (LLMs, sometimes spuriously called “AI”). UCSB is a university committed to learning, and no educational entity should encourage students to use plagiarism machines that discourage critical thinking.\n\n\n2025-04-14-ucsb-git\nN/A\n\n\n2025-04-14-ucsb-git\nIt would be helpful if there was some time at the beginning to elaborate on some of the vocabulary (commits, staging, adds, etc).

Also, I still do not feel clear on which of the setup steps of connecting GitBash to the online GitHub need to be completed during each start up of the software vs now it is setup and I do not need to recreate the keys.\n\n\n2025-04-14-ucsb-git\nlist of commands of Git"

It might be good to think carefully about where some people might not know what the goal of a command is. Perhaps you expect people to come in with that knowledge, which is fine, but it was the sense I got from some of the questions that were asked.\n\n\n2025-02-18-ucsb-intermediater\nif an instructor was coming from a non-coding background they might be able to present the material in a different way.

We will not be covering…”)\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nSometimes, terminal commands and flags can be cryptic; I think it would be helpful to explain what each flag means (especially when doing the ssh part) so that those who want to can appreciate what’s being done.\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nI wish that this workshop (and others) could have a demo of a real-world use case. It’s all well and good to learn the very basics, but then when I think about applying this to my workflow or to existing collaborations I have I can’t even picture what it would look like. If the last 30 minutes could have been a demo with a more complex set of files and a larger slate of collaborators, that would be good.\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nSome other students mentioned “branching” as a topic they want to be covered, which might warrant a third day for the workshop\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nThe pace was a little fast at first, but then it got better\n\n\n2024-11-05-ucsb-webscraping\nI mainly felt like it was a bit long, 4 hours spread out over two days. I think it could be shortened to 2-3 hours. Or instead, maybe provide a detailed schedule of what topics will be discussed, because I didn’t really need the first 30-40 min of the first workshop (I knew how HTML worked already, more or less) and was a bit disengaged during it. It’s difficult to accommodate different skill/knowledge levels and the workshop did that by going from the ground up with basics, which is nice if I were someone that needed that, I’m just not.; ; More about the length of the workshop: I did have to skip class to attend, though there are always trade-offs with scheduling at other times too. Making the workshop shorter would alleviate some schedule conflicts though.\n\n\n2024-10-08-ucsb-r\nBreaks could be sooner like an hour 10 minutes in\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nLonger, mor github functions taught\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nI hope you could provide us with the full learning materials that we can look back in the future in form of a pdf or something like that.\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nA summary of the material covered after the workshop\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nFor the scope of the topic the workshop was perfect. Lots of possibilities for advanced beginner workshops–working on our own stuff with instructor support, learning about branches, best practices for collaborative work come to mind. Could probably fit 15 min of the latter into this one, since it went a little short. (better a little short than a little long tho.)\n\n\n2024-11-05-ucsb-webscraping\nmore detailed.\n\n\n2024-11-05-ucsb-webscraping\nmore discussion time\n\n\n2024-11-05-ucsb-webscraping\nI believe we all have different projects in mind. It would be nice if we can look at our own webpage that we are interested in and extract some data using the tools we have learned from the workshop."

It’s difficult to accommodate different skill/knowledge levels and the workshop did that by going from the ground up with basics, which is nice if I were someone that needed that, I’m just not.; ; More about the length of the workshop: I did have to skip class to attend, though there are always trade-offs with scheduling at other times too.

Having additional instructors to help out if you got stuck while working on the exercises was really great! It was engaging the whole time.\n\n\n2024-07-02-ucsb-spreadsheets\nInstructors very helpful, had a good flow, and were very clear.\n\n\n2024-07-02-ucsb-spreadsheets\nAwesome job using the microphone and ensuring the font size of the content shown on the main screen was enlarged. They’re accessibility basics, but they’re often forgotten.\n\n\n2024-07-02-ucsb-spreadsheets\nThe instructors made a daunting area of knowledge very accessible and showing practical applications.\n\n\n2024-07-02-ucsb-spreadsheets\nmaking sure everyone was understanding and on the same page as the instructor;\n\n\n2024-07-02-ucsb-spreadsheets\nThe instructors were ready to help at every moment\n\n\n2024-07-02-ucsb-spreadsheets\nin-person, hands-on. VERY, very helpful in the learning of this material.\n\n\n2024-07-02-ucsb-spreadsheets\npre workshop information helped everyone starting the workshop\n\n\n2024-07-02-ucsb-spreadsheets\nI liked the exercises and the ability to ask questions in class at any time."

Plus, they really assumed people already knew the Xpath terms and such. This is what an early blurb said: “introducing tools for turning web pages into analyzable data. We will explore common web scraping scenarios and learn how to use a web browser to extract data from websites without needing to write code.” Huh.\n\n\n2024-02-27-ucsb-webscraping\nAnswered my question throughly and explained it in a second way\n\n\n2024-02-27-ucsb-webscraping\nThe workshop was ok, I don’t feel like I learned 3 hours worth of material.

Perhaps the workbook and course flow should be reorganized. Or having a cheatsheet available of commands we have learned so far so participants don’t have to scroll through the workbook endlessly when trying to solve a challenge. I think a fully online course would work much better (since I can’t attend in person, but grateful to have access to these courses working remotely, so I’ll take whatever you can swing!). One of the instructors shell was color coded, which was sooo much easier to follow along even though its not what my own shell looks like. Maybe multiple shell windows up at the same time so when working in nano the previous commands are still available for those who are a step or two behind. I think it would be great to emphasize somewhere in the course why command line is still important when working on modern computers. Looking forward to the next course, thanks!"

When the instructors got confused or made mistakes and had to try to fix them, it made learning already confusing things even more confusing because I was lost on what was a mistake and what was correct.

Perhaps the workbook and course flow should be reorganized. Or having a cheatsheet available of commands we have learned so far so participants don’t have to scroll through the workbook endlessly when trying to solve a challenge. I think a fully online course would work much better (since I can’t attend in person, but grateful to have access to these courses working remotely, so I’ll take whatever you can swing!). One of the instructors shell was color coded, which was sooo much easier to follow along even though its not what my own shell looks like. Maybe multiple shell windows up at the same time so when working in nano the previous commands are still available for those who are a step or two behind. I think it would be great to emphasize somewhere in the course why command line is still important when working on modern computers. Looking forward to the next course, thanks!\n\n\n2022-07-19-ucsb-git\nGreat workshop but it might help if the instructors do not go too fast sometimes since we need to execute commands. Thank you!\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nIt would be super helpful if there was an additional day allotted to this workshop as we were unable to cover everything as planned.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\n’- There were a few uncertainties in the material taught on the 2nd day; - Some parts of the workshop were a bit fast paced; - There were a few technical difficulties on zoom in the beginning (but they were resolved in the end);\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nEverything was good. thank you.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nPerhaps providing the scripts ahead or time or afterward so that we can re-do the lessons at our leisure after the workshop.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nwould have liked to learn how to import data (e.g., from csv files, etc) to work with.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nI think some of the instructors that are not teaching at the moment should be monitoring the room a bit more. I was stuck and put up my pink sticky note, but didn’t get help until the break.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nn/a;\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nNot all instructors had a strong grasp on R, which caused some slow-downs and also caused some confusing presentation of the material. ; ; It would also be useful if the instructors presented clear and self-constrained scripts in these lessons (i.e. how one would actually organize scripts in their own work). This was done inconsistently across trainers, and there were some errors in how the scripts were managed. For example, it would be useful to tell the learners that it is important to clear your environment between scripts and to make sure that objects referenced only in previous scripts are not used in your current script.\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nN/A\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nbetter timing - although instructor commented that they rarely get through the whole thing; or plan more realistic timing goals\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nAs someone fairly new to R, perhaps a longer class (more days) to go through the lessons slower, step by step. I can do this on my own now, but it would have been nice to have more time to learn the steps. Sometimes I would have an error in my typing that took me awhile to catch and fix and by then the workshop had moved on. I was usually able to catch up or fix it later by redoing the lesson in my own timeframe.\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nincluding a quick tutorial video on the set-up page for how to get the data up n running before may help alleviate some of the issues that required troubleshooting at the beginning of the workshop\n\n\n2022-08-16-ucsb-machlearn-r\nit’s always a struggle, especially in piloted workshops, to have a good balance between getting through the planned material and allowing enough time in the workshops to provide necessary background/context info and answer questions. The first day was paced a bit fast, but we made it through the material; the second day accommodated more time for explanations, but we did not make it through the material."

It’s kinda hot and stuffy inside the room.\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nmaking sure that they are familiar with the lesson and exactly what they are going to show and that there aren’t any issues before they lead the lesson. When the instructors got confused or made mistakes and had to try to fix them, it made learning already confusing things even more confusing because I was lost on what was a mistake and what was correct. In general, I believe it went a little too fast for me\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nNot jumping around directories quickly\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nBetter coordination between instructors if other instructors need to interrupt the instructor currently teaching to better explain a point or answer a question\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nClearer syllabus and more exercises\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nBreak time can come a little soon.\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\ngrep gets a little complicated with escape characters, I think those could be added to the workshop\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nnone\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nsharing instructors use for bash-shell and participants briefly sharing relevance to their own work (I mostly work in rstudio on datasets, or morphing datasets into better datasets, I rarely work with tons of files…)\n\n\n2022-07-12-ucsb-bash\nI found it particularly difficult to follow along in this hybrid course. Perhaps the workbook and course flow should be reorganized. Or having a cheatsheet available of commands we have learned so far so participants don’t have to scroll through the workbook endlessly when trying to solve a challenge. I think a fully online course would work much better (since I can’t attend in person, but grateful to have access to these courses working remotely, so I’ll take whatever you can swing!). One of the instructors shell was color coded, which was sooo much easier to follow along even though its not what my own shell looks like. Maybe multiple shell windows up at the same time so when working in nano the previous commands are still available for those who are a step or two behind. I think it would be great to emphasize somewhere in the course why command line is still important when working on modern computers. Looking forward to the next course, thanks!\n\n\n2022-07-19-ucsb-git\nGreat workshop but it might help if the instructors do not go too fast sometimes since we need to execute commands. Thank you!\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nIt would be super helpful if there was an additional day allotted to this workshop as we were unable to cover everything as planned.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\n’- There were a few uncertainties in the material taught on the 2nd day; - Some parts of the workshop were a bit fast paced; - There were a few technical difficulties on zoom in the beginning (but they were resolved in the end);\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nEverything was good. thank you.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nPerhaps providing the scripts ahead or time or afterward so that we can re-do the lessons at our leisure after the workshop.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nwould have liked to learn how to import data (e.g., from csv files, etc) to work with.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nI think some of the instructors that are not teaching at the moment should be monitoring the room a bit more. I was stuck and put up my pink sticky note, but didn’t get help until the break.\n\n\n2022-07-26-ucsb-R\nn/a;\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nNot all instructors had a strong grasp on R, which caused some slow-downs and also caused some confusing presentation of the material. ; ; It would also be useful if the instructors presented clear and self-constrained scripts in these lessons (i.e. how one would actually organize scripts in their own work). This was done inconsistently across trainers, and there were some errors in how the scripts were managed. For example, it would be useful to tell the learners that it is important to clear your environment between scripts and to make sure that objects referenced only in previous scripts are not used in your current script.\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nN/A\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nbetter timing - although instructor commented that they rarely get through the whole thing; or plan more realistic timing goals\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nAs someone fairly new to R, perhaps a longer class (more days) to go through the lessons slower, step by step. I can do this on my own now, but it would have been nice to have more time to learn the steps. Sometimes I would have an error in my typing that took me awhile to catch and fix and by then the workshop had moved on. I was usually able to catch up or fix it later by redoing the lesson in my own timeframe.\n\n\n2022-08-09-ucsb-r-geospatial\nincluding a quick tutorial video on the set-up page for how to get the data up n running before may help alleviate some of the issues that required troubleshooting at the beginning of the workshop\n\n\n2022-08-16-ucsb-machlearn-r\nit’s always a struggle, especially in piloted workshops, to have a good balance between getting through the planned material and allowing enough time in the workshops to provide necessary background/context info and answer questions. The first day was paced a bit fast, but we made it through the material; the second day accommodated more time for explanations, but we did not make it through the material."

Instructors were clear and helpful. Nice to have so much staff in the room."

We will not be covering…”)\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nSometimes, terminal commands and flags can be cryptic; I think it would be helpful to explain what each flag means (especially when doing the ssh part) so that those who want to can appreciate what’s being done.\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nI wish that this workshop (and others) could have a demo of a real-world use case. It’s all well and good to learn the very basics, but then when I think about applying this to my workflow or to existing collaborations I have I can’t even picture what it would look like. If the last 30 minutes could have been a demo with a more complex set of files and a larger slate of collaborators, that would be good.\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nSome other students mentioned “branching” as a topic they want to be covered, which might warrant a third day for the workshop\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nThe pace was a little fast at first, but then it got better\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nLonger, mor github functions taught\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nI hope you could provide us with the full learning materials that we can look back in the future in form of a pdf or something like that.\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nA summary of the material covered after the workshop\n\n\n2024-10-22-ucsb-git\nFor the scope of the topic the workshop was perfect. Lots of possibilities for advanced beginner workshops–working on our own stuff with instructor support, learning about branches, best practices for collaborative work come to mind. Could probably fit 15 min of the latter into this one, since it went a little short. (better a little short than a little long tho.)"

There were a few times where the instructors broke down the code, explaining what each piece did and that was AWESOME! I wish the whole class would’ve been like that.

Or why we were learning the particular things we were working on in the course. ; ; ; Since this course is a “data analysis and visualization” class I think it would be best to have the workshop follow a small project. Get some datasets where the population is people instead of animals. And, work together to answer a very simple but specific research question throughout the course and generate some graphs at the end.\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nI think less time reviewing the previous weeks material would improve the workshop\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nslower at some points\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nWe lost time in all sessions because people were lost on where they had organized their files, so maybe thinking of a more general and accessible way to managing folders and files can be useful\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nWe lost time in all sessions because people were lost on where they had organized their files, so maybe thinking of a more general and accessible way to managing folders and files can be useful\n\n\n2024-07-09-ucsb-python\nMaybe applied into a single project so there’s one thread of logic (instead of broken up into chunks).

Get some datasets where the population is people instead of animals.

I mention this because I think the topic of version control can be very confusing to newcomers. For people who are brand new to the whole topic, who I believe would be the target audience, I think it might be helpful to spend more time at the beginning going over what version control is about and the benefits of using it. You already do this, but I would expand out on it.\n\n\n2024-01-30-ucsb-git\nMake it more clear what programs need to be downloaded and installed prior to the workshop.\n\n\n2024-02-27-ucsb-webscraping\nMaybe go over more examples of how webscraping can be used in research settings.\n\n\n2024-02-27-ucsb-webscraping\nmake it really introductory?

Even if there’s no time to demo starting with something that we’d actually want to apply, then walking the more complex topic back would have been more useful."

I mention this because I think the topic of version control can be very confusing to newcomers. For people who are brand new to the whole topic, who I believe would be the target audience, I think it might be helpful to spend more time at the beginning going over what version control is about and the benefits of using it. You already do this, but I would expand out on it.\n\n\n2024-01-30-ucsb-git\nMake it more clear what programs need to be downloaded and installed prior to the workshop.\n\n\n2024-02-27-ucsb-webscraping\nMaybe go over more examples of how webscraping can be used in research settings.\n\n\n2024-02-27-ucsb-webscraping\nmake it really introductory? Persuade me that scraping a web site is quicker and faster than just copying it and pasting it into excel or word and then extracting what I want. Don’t assume I know what you mean by an “anchor.”\n\n\n2024-02-27-ucsb-webscraping\nBetter explanation of possible uses for these tools\n\n\n2024-02-27-ucsb-webscraping\nIt felt like the XPath instructor didn’t know much about the Scraper tool, but I think that doesn’t necessarily need to be resolved more even knowledge of the entire workshop maybe\n\n\n2024-02-27-ucsb-webscraping\nI understand starting us with the basics but talking us through or referring us to how it could be built into something more complex is a loop I was expecting to see completed but never came about. Even if there’s no time to demo starting with something that we’d actually want to apply, then walking the more complex topic back would have been more useful."

For example, when covering decision trees, they used a real-world analogy related to everyday decision-making, which made it much easier to understand. Additionally, a helper guided me through debugging a coding error, ensuring I grasped the logic behind the solution rather than just fixing the issue. Their support significantly enhanced my learning experience."

It would be helpful to go through a real life example from beginning to end without over simplifying the problem.\n\n\n2025-02-25-ucsb-ml\nI wish there was more about using ML for things other than handling large data sets. For example, as an engineer, I’m most interested in ML for design optimization. I know there’s lots of different implementations of this out there, so a review of the strengths and weaknesses of different ML paradigms would be useful\n\n\n2025-02-25-ucsb-ml\npacing felt weird? didn’t learn that much conceptual stuff or when we did it was very slow? Then typing I guess is not slow it’s fine, but sometimes the way we talked about the typing was slow, or rather inefficient/not fluid teaching wise. Like somehow more awkward than it should have been?\n\n\n2025-02-25-ucsb-ml\nI would have like to dive a little deeper into additional examples of machine learning. Perhaps using an additional dataset, or at least exploring the use of multiple predictor values rather than only the appache score. Some more basic code was overexplained, while the arguments of more advanced methods/functions related to the sci-kit library were kind of glossed over/rushed. Less time could be spent answering questions/comments from participants that weren’t really in the scope of what we’re learning. EX: spending 5-10 minutes to talk about whether certain predictor variables in the dataset were statistically sound to include because they are correlated with/calculated based on other predictor variables (we didn’t even end up using the variable of question and that participant didn’t even attend the second day).\n\n\n2025-02-25-ucsb-ml\n1. Pacing Adjustments – Some sections felt a bit fast-paced, especially for beginners. Providing additional time for complex topics could enhance understanding.; 2. More Real-World Case Studies – Including more practical, real-world examples of machine learning applications would help connect concepts to industry use cases.; 3. Pre-Workshop Preparation Materials – Offering optional pre-workshop readings or short tutorials could help participants with varying backgrounds start on the same level.; 4. More Breaks – Shorter but more frequent breaks could improve focus and prevent fatigue, especially during intensive coding sessions.; 5. Advanced Follow-Up Sessions – A follow-up session or additional resources for those who want to go beyond the basics would be beneficial."

The rest of the workshop seems interesting just for learning sake but the above is a more specific thing I hope to strengthen.\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nI would like to learn the basics of working in linux with file directories, running programs, simple commands. I will need to be able to do this for some upcoming data analysis.\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nlearn how to use this and apply to real-life cases\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nbest practices for running code and storing data; integrating with RStudio; helpful tips of useful commands\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nNew programming skills\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nThank you! I have been offered the use of supercomputing resources from my old postdoc position, and I would like to improve my Unix skills to make full use of this resource. I currently use MATLAB on my compter/laptop and am learning Python and Jupyter notebook. My Unix skills are very limited. The Python interfaces with the supercomputing environment are well-developed. I hope to learn more about how I can help to acess the resources more easily.\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nI’ve never really understood what the Terminal app on my MacBook did, so I am hoping to learn more about it. Beyond that, I am hoping to acquire new skills that will help me manage data.\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nUnix Shell\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nI want to be a data scientist, so I think it is really important to understand Unix systems"

That extra context would be nice. I did learn a lot about file navigation though and that will be great for when I’m pushing and pulling to github on my terminal as before this workshop I wasn’t very effective at that navigation.\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nThe beginning of the workshop moved very quickly. It would be helpful especially during the start for beginners if the instructor paused so I could read the commands they typed before the executed the command.; Also, viewing the Windows interface was much easier than the mac because of the color coding, so I would have preferred to have seen that interface the entire time.\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nI had a hard time managing the ’ thumbs up’ feature when asked. I found I could either follow, or respond. Again, I need to invest in another screen which would make this easier. I have a tiny laptop screen.\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nI am not sure if it was beyond the scope of the workshop, but I thought it would have been helpful to see some applications of why I would use the shell instead of the GUI. I feel like the things I learned today (moving between directories, renaming files, copying files, etc.) I could’ve just done easier in the GUI.\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nI think it was great. I liked the breaks in the middle.\n\n\n2025-04-11-ucsb-shell\nSometimes it went a bit quickly, particularly when multiple lines of code were needed for an exercise. I was usually able to catch up though!"
