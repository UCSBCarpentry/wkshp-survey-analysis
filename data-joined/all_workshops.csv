Perhaps the workbook and course flow should be reorganized. Or having a cheatsheet available of commands we have learned so far so participants don't have to scroll through the workbook endlessly when trying to solve a challenge. I think a fully online course would work much better (since I can't attend in person, but grateful to have access to these courses working remotely, so I'll take whatever you can swing!). One of the instructors shell was color coded, which was sooo much easier to follow along even though its not what my own shell looks like. Maybe multiple shell windows up at the same time so when working in nano the previous commands are still available for those who are a step or two behind. I think it would be great to emphasize somewhere in the course why command line is still important when working on modern computers.

– Rushing through material, resulting in me feeling lost, confused, and inept;
– Audibly talking to one another about worrying that they were running overtime, undermining confidence in the workshop and instilling a sense of shame in me for not understanding more quickly;
– Acting confused by questions about morals, ethics, and privacy, implicitly dismissing students' concerns about such;
– Repeatedly modifying instructions immediately given with accompanying warnings about how following the instruction incorrectly would result in negative consequences, creating uncertainty and fear about whether an instruction was safe to follow or would harm a student's device",A strength of the workshop was simulcasting the instructor's screen on screens at every table. Being able to see the instructor's command line and try to follow along at least helped a little bit.,"The workshop could be improved in the following ways (nonexhaustive):; ; - Be more prepared for student confusion, especially in a workshop advertised as being suitable for beginners.; - Instruct more clearly, using sentences that don't require immediate caveats for fear of prompting a student to do something catastrophic to their computers; - Understand Git and GitHub more thoroughly. More than once, instructors confessed their ignorance about how to answer seemingly elementary questions about the programs. They seemed to know how to plug commands into Git but not how or why any of it worked.; – Explain the utility of Git and GitHub. The case for why or how these tools improve upon information management practices students might already be using was rarely made persuasively.; – Teach students how to protect their privacy from malicious actors. In an age of ""cyber stalking,"" ""doxxing,"" and grassroots fascist threats (and even violence) against people in higher education, I was frankly flabbergasted by the instructors' devil-may-care attitude toward students connecting themselves to an open-access repository from which information seemingly cannot readily be deleted.; - Divest from tools that depend on Large Language Models (LLMs, sometimes spuriously called ""AI"").
