Perhaps the workbook and course flow should be reorganized.

I think a fully online course would work much better (since I can't attend in person, but grateful to have access to these courses working remotely, so I'll take whatever you can swing!). One of the instructors shell was color coded, which was sooo much easier to follow along even though its not what my own shell looks like. Maybe multiple shell windows up at the same time so when working in nano the previous commands are still available for those who are a step or two behind. I think it would be great to emphasize somewhere in the course why command line is still important when working on modern computers.
